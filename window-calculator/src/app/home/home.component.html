            If you own a home in or near Tucson, AZ that has at least one single-pane window, the Window Calculator is for you! This tool uses local climate data to calculate the health, comfort, and energy efficiency benefits of three different window upgrade options. These three options offer the best long-term savings in our climate compared to their initial cost.

                The key difference between single-pane and double-pane windows is that single-pane windows are made of a single sheet of glass, while double-pane windows are made of two sheets of glass that are separated by an air gap.
              </div>
              <div class="mt-3">
                If you look where the glass meets the frame, sometimes you can see whether there are one or two sheets of glass. If you can't tell or aren't sure, the reflection method can help.
                Try holding a small object close to the glass, like a pen or pencil. Look closely at the glass -- if you can see one reflection, it's a single-pane window, and if you see two reflections, it's a double-pane window.

                    The amount of energy that a building uses is determined by both the way that heat flows through it and the electricity used by appliances and lighting.
                    When more heat is entering a building than it's releasing, a cooling system will turn on and use energy to lower the temperature back to a comfortable level.

                    The Window Calculator uses typical values about parts of your home (like the insulating ability of different window types) information about the physics of heat flow and to determine how much energy the three upgrade options save by reducing heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer.

                    The cost of window upgrades will vary based on a lot of factors, including base window size, quantity, quality, installation complexity, brand, installer, labor costs, permitting, rebates, and more.
                    In order to estimate a reasonable total expected cost for each upgrade option, the Window Calculator relies on information from manufacturers and installers to create a range of potential costs for a typical project, based on the total number and size of the windows considered for upgrades.

                  Embodied carbon is one measurement of the environmental impact that a product has before it is installed in your home, including manufacturing and transportation.

                  Upgrading your windows can have a big impact on the comfort of your home, helping it feel cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. This is because thermal comfort depends on both the air temperature and the temperature of things around you.
                  The Window Calculator uses information about the typical insulating and shading properties of different window types to determines how hot your windows will get in the summer.
                  This is then used to calculate how much hotter your windows make your home feel.
