        <h2>Thermal Comfort</h2>
        <div>
          Windows play a huge role in how comfortable your home is.  While your HVAC systems counteract the unwanted heat let into and out of your home, the biggest impact on comfort from windows comes from the temperature of the glass itself. This is because the temperature your body feels depends on both the air temperature and the temperature of surfaces around you, like a brick wall in the sun. The upgrades recommended by the Window Calculator - low-e window film, low-e storm windows, and ENERGY STAR replacement windows - all work to control the temperature of your windows during extreme heat, keeping you cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.

          Low-e window film cuts the negative impact of existing windows on comfort in half by decreasing the amount of solar radiation that passes through, and reflecting energy from the hot glass back outside.

          Low-e storm windows can have an even bigger impact on comfort than low-e window film, depending on the frame material of your existing windows, because they eliminate the effects poorly insulated frames.
