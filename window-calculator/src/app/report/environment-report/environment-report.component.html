        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <div>
          The Window Calculator recommends three different window upgrade options that could have the greatest impact on your home’s carbon footprint - low-e window film, low-e storm windows, and ENERGY STAR replacement windows. Each option causes some greenhouse gas emissions through its production and transportation, known as embodied carbon. This amount, however, is significantly smaller than the resulting greenhouse gas reduction created by energy savings.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-2">
          If you are interested in minimizing your home’s carbon footprint, an energy assessment can help you identify which upgrades will have the biggest impact.

          Low-e window film doesn’t require as much energy to produce as products with glass do, creating a much lower embodied carbon. If your existing windows are not at the end of their life and storm windows are out of your budget, low-e window film can provide a cost-effective way to make an impact on your home’s carbon footprint, while keeping your current windows out of the landfill.

        <div class="mt-2">
          ENERGY STAR replacement windows vary in environmental impact based on the selected frame material. Aluminum, for example, requires a lot of energy to produce, so aluminum frames have embodied carbon more than twenty times higher than wood frames. While all frame materials can achieve the same great energy savings each year, the lifetime energy savings vary because some frame materials, like vinyl, don’t last as long as others.
