        <h2>Sound Blocking</h2>
        <div>
          Old, single-pane windows are often a weak point for sound insulation, letting unwanted noise into your home. Two of the window upgrade options recommended by the Window Calculator -  low-e storm windows and ENERGY STAR replacement windows - can block 2-4 times more sound to help protect your privacy and sanity.

        <div class="mt-2">
          Sound transmission through windows is measured through two different ratings: STC and OITC. STC (or Sound Transmission Class) is a measure of how well a window blocks commons sounds, like conversation. OITC (or Outdoor/Indoor Transmission Class) is a measure of how well a window blocks lower-level noises, like airplanes and construction. For both, a higher number is better.

          Low-e window film doesn’t affect sound transmission through windows, since it doesn’t change the thickness of the insulating air space. If your windows leak air where they meet the wall, however, resealing your windows is a low-cost way to improve your sound insulation and save energy.

          Low-e storm windows improve air sealing and work with existing windows to create an thick air gap that blocks a lot of sound. They are most effective at reducing sound transmission when installed at least one inch away from your existing windows.

          ENERGY STAR replacement windows block around twice as much sound as single-pane windows because of the insulated gap between the two panes of glass. They are typically as effective as the windows used in brand new homes.
