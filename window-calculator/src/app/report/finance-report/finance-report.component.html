          The Window Calculator recommends three different window upgrade options that typically have the best energy savings in Tucson's climate compared to their initial cost.
          These options — low-e window film, low-e storm windows, and ENERGY STAR replacement windows — offer a range of price points based on your budget.

          Low-E film is a lower cost window upgrade that still provides meaningful energy savings for your home.
          It typically costs $10 - $30 per square foot of window and lowers heating and cooling costs by around 10%, paying off its initial cost in 1-6 years.
          While similar to window tinting, Low-E window film provides much greater savings for only a small increase in initial price.
