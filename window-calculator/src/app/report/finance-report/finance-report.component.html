          The Window Calculator recommends three different window upgrade options that typically have the best energy savings in Tucson's climate compared to their initial cost.
          These options — low-e window film, low-e storm windows, and ENERGY STAR replacement windows — offer a range of price points based on your budget.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-2">The potential energy savings described on this page are calculated based on the difference in heat loss and gain between your existing windows and each upgrade option, based on the information you shared about your home.</div>
        <div class="mt-2">A professional energy assessor can also help you figure out which upgrade options are the best investment.</div>

          Low-E film is a lower cost window upgrade that still provides meaningful energy savings for your home.
          It typically costs $10 - $30 per square foot of window and lowers heating and cooling costs by around 10%, paying off its initial cost in 1-6 years.
          While similar to window tinting, Low-E window film provides much greater savings for only a small increase in initial price.
